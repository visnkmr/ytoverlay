# Please Note: 

Fire TV OS 6 lacks the accessibility service options to be able to enable Overlay permission for any app, hence, Unless permission is allowed manually the overlays won't be displayed. 

In order to enable the permission visit: [https://visnkmr.github.io/overlay-permission-help](https://visnkmr.github.io/overlay-permission-help)

We hope you will continue supporting us by **downloading, using and rating our apps in the appstore** @ [myapps](https://visnkmr.github.io/myapps).
